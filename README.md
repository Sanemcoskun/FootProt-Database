# FootProt-Database
FoodProt is a specialized database offering protein sequences from over 10,000 genomes across 14 food categories. It provides millions of unique sequences for accurate protein identification and functional analysis of food microbiomes, enhancing metaproteomics studies on food quality and safety.

We used Prodigal to analyze prokaryotic data, and to streamline the process and improve efficiency, we utilized several scripts.
